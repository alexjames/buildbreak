Multiprogramming - multiple programs running on the same CPU (context switch)
Multiprocessing - multiple processing cores

Moore's law is still allows the number of transistors on a chip to exponentially increase. But thermal limitations have prevented clock rates
from scaling, using practical heat sink technology.
